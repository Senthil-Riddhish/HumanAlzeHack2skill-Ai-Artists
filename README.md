Our project aims to revolutionize education through an AI-driven automated grading, evaluation, and feedback system. Powered by advanced NLP techniques, it assesses written responses with precision, the system provides a comprehensive evaluation by automatically detecting and correcting grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. It also performs real-time plagiarism checks, ensuring academic integrity. Beyond grading, it delivers personalized feedback and detailed performance analysis for each student, accommodating diverse learning styles. Teachers can create tests, students submit responses for automated evaluation and grading.

We‚Äôre aiming to develop an AI-driven automated grading, evaluation, feedback, and recommendation system tailored for educational institutions.

## Purpose üí∞
- AI serves as the backbone of our application, driving automation and personalization across various key functions. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), it ensures precise evaluation of written responses and detects errors effectively. Through machine learning, automated grading is executed based on predefined criteria, maintaining consistency and fairness.
- Moreover, AI conducts in-depth performance analysis by analyzing student data, generating detailed reports, and offering personalized recommendations for improvement. This includes tailored feedback, catering to individual student performance levels. Additionally, our system incorporates a recommendation engine, suggesting relevant articles and links based on student performance, fostering continuous learning and growth.

## A Brief of the Prototype
Our prototype leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize the educational grading process. By integrating advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, the system ensures precise evaluation and comprehensive feedback for written student responses.
Key Features:
  - NLP-Powered Assessment: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models for accurate error detection,grammar correction, and sentence structure analysis.
  - Automated Grading: Employs ML algorithms to grade responses consistently based on predefined rubrics, ensuring unbiased and efficient evaluation.
  - Real-Time Plagiarism Detection: Implements sophisticated AI techniques to compare student submissions against extensive databases, safeguarding academic integrity.
  - Performance Analytics: Analyzes student performance data to generate detailed insights, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
  - Personalized Feedback: Provides tailored recommendations and feedback, including text-based suggestions, visual aids, and audio recordings, to support diverse learning styles.
  -  Recommendation Engine: Uses AI to suggest relevant articles and learning resources based on individual student performance and needs.

## Features

- Predicts the performance of a student based on their marks
- Provides insights on which students are slow, average, or good performers
- Assists in creating personalized learning plans for students
- Improves the quality of education by providing valuable insights to teachers


## How it works

- The system uses SVM(support vector machine) algorithm to predict the academic performance of students. 
- We are working with a real time data set of past 3 years student provided by the college to work on our innovative idea.
- We have also implemented some feature engineering and statistical engineering techniques to make our model more reliable and accurate
